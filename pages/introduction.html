    <p><strong>SRPG Engine MV</strong>, also known as <strong>SRPG Converter MV</strong> or <strong>SRPGコンバータＭＶ</strong>, is a series of plugins that convert <a href = "https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mv" target= "_blank">RPG Maker MV</a> to a turn-based strategic role-playing game engine. This project was initiated by Gakuto Mikagami, the author of <a href = "https://github.com/Echizen-ham/SRPGcore" target= "_blank">SRPG_Core</a>. Later, many developers including me contributed to this project by making extensions. This site is my portfolio on the SRPG Converter MV project.</p>
    <p>My plugins are mainly for the battle system and UI. With my plugins, you can build SRPG games with interesting features, including battle preparation, advanced AI, AoE battle system, event interactions, aura skills, summoning skills, and more. They also allow you to visualize important information from battlers, skills, and terrains.</p>
