    <p><strong>SRPG Engine MV</strong>, also known as <strong>SRPG Converter MV</strong> or <strong>SRPGコンバータＭＶ</strong>, is a series of plugins that convert <a href = "https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mv" target= "_blank">RPG Maker MV</a> to a turn-based strategic role-playing game engine. This project was initiated by Gakuto Mikagami, the author of <a href = "https://github.com/Echizen-ham/SRPGcore" target= "_blank">SRPG_Core</a>. Later, several developers including me contributed to this project by making extensions. This site is my portfolio on the SRPG Converter MV project.</p>
    <p>My plugins greatly improve the battle system and UI. Using my plugin, you can build SRPG games with interesting features you might see in other famous SRPG games like Fire Emblem. My plugins realized battle preparation, advanced AI, AoE battle system, event interactions, aura skills, summoning skills, and more. They also allow you to visualize important information such as battler status, attack range, and terrain effects.</p>
