# Shoukang_SRPG_plugin
This is a collection of my SRPG plugins. It's based on the SRPG engine (converter) which converts the RPG Maker MV to a turn-based Strategic RPG Engine. 
With my plugin, you can enjoy many new functional features including Battle preparation, move method, aura skills, advanced interactions, and more to build an SRPG game with more interesting strategies. I'm still actively improving them.

## More:
There are functional plugins that is hard to show the idea with GIF demo. But they are also very useful! Give them a try!
